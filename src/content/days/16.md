Have long commands you can't remember? Or commands you wish an agent got right the first time? Try using workflows 💡

- Hit `cmd+p` and type "[Create workflow](https://docs.warp.dev/knowledge-and-collaboration/warp-drive/workflows)"
- Save your command with arguments to fill in
- Watch the agent reference workflows as context
- Or, run commands yourself by searching from the command palette
