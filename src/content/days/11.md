Wouldn't it be nice if vim motions worked in the terminal?

- [Enable from your Warp settings](https://docs.warp.dev/terminal/editor/vim)
- Hit `esc` for vim motions. No weird bash bindings, they work how you expect
- Works for writing agent prompts too
- Plus, vim motions extend to the git diff viewer
