Did you know you can save env vars in Warp?

- Hit `cmd+p` and type "[Create new environment variables](https://docs.warp.dev/knowledge-and-collaboration/warp-drive/environment-variables)"
- Save groups of keys for your project
- Sync to a shared "drive" with your team
- Load those env vars with a click. It'll just run `export` in your session

We support 1Password and LastPass keys too 👀
