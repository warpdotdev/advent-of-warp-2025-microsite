Did you know you can run Warp [from a CLI](https://docs.warp.dev/platform/cli)?

- `warp agent run` to query our agent locally
- `warp agent run-ambient` to kick off an agent in a cloud sandbox (great for external use)

Then, you can SSH into your running agent and interact, just like a local agent 🙌
