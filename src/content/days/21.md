Did you know you can call Warp's agent from a GitHub Action?

- Use the `warp-agent-action` reference in your action
- Pass your prompt with an API key
- Watch the agent get to work, with codebase access 👀

[Watch our walkthrough](https://docs.warp.dev/integrations/github-actions/demo-issue-triage-bot) to add a "needs info" label to underwritten bug reports.
