There are *so many* AI models now. Instead of sifting through model numbers (Opus 4.5, Gemini 3, etc), what if you could have "profiles" (Smart, Fast, etc)?

- [Create a profile from your Warp AI settings](https://docs.warp.dev/agents/using-agents/agent-profiles-permissions)
- Name the profile for a given model
- Set your permissions for that profile (file writes, MCP servers, web search, etc)
