Find it annoying to hit "always approve" for every different command or subcommand an agent runs?

We agreed, so we built an "auto approve" button. Toggle at any point in an agent conversation to allow commands, diffs, and MCP calls. You can even [make this the default](https://docs.warp.dev/agents/using-agents/agent-profiles-permissions#agent-permissions) from settings!
